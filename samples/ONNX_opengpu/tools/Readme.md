# Converting Dynamic Batch ONNX model to FP16 (for Yolov5 r6.1)

- This script will modify the dynamic batch onnx model to fp16.
- Inside the ultralytics/yolov5 repo, it provides script to export onnx model
    - It allows either export fp16 onnx model or fp32 onnx model with dynamic batch size.
    - But it does not support export model with both dynamic and fp16.
- One easy way is export the model to dynamc onnx first, and modify the model to fp16.
- In this script, we will show how to convert the model from fp32 to fp16
- Please prepare a dynamic fp32 yolov5s dynamic model by using the export.py provided in ultralytics/yolov5 repo
    - `python3 export.py --weights yolov5s.pt --include onnx --dynamic`
- Before we start, we neend to install some dependencies

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

- Now we can execute the onnx_model_modifier.py to modify the dynamic batch fp32 yolov5s model to dynamic batch fp16 model.
